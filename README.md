# ⚙️ My Dotfiles Repository

This repository contains my personal dotfiles for Omarchy setup.


## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* **Git** installed on your system.
* A basic understanding of the **command line**.
* **Backup your existing dotfiles if you care about them**

### Installation (Direct Replacement Method, if you know any other method just do it as you know)

Just replace the files from your .config to the files from my repo, should work just fine!
