# ⚙️ My Dotfiles Repository

This repository contains my personal dotfiles for Omarchy setup.

**IMPORTANT:** My waybar config assumes you have NetworkManager and gazelle-tui installed, and it assumes your default terminal is kitty, so if it's not so, you make the change for yourself inside the config.

**INFO:** The keybind are a little different from the originals, if you don't like them, just change them, they are located in hypr/bindings.conf.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* **Git** installed on your system.
* A basic understanding of the **command line**.
* **Backup your existing dotfiles if you care about them**

### Installation (Direct Replacement Method, if you know any other method just do it as you know)

Just replace the files from your .config to the files from my repo, should work just fine!
